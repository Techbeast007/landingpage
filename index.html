                    I recently attended a program to become an ICF certified Coach and Gaurav Arora was our facilitator for the Coaching Program. Gaurav is a very accomplished Coach and a self-aware human being in particular. He brings his authentic self to the program, helps connect the theory with real life, enables a seamless blend in the story of coaching. His ability to captivate attention is outstanding and does a tremendous job for the Erickson Coaching International Program which spreads the word of building his ambition of making India the coaching capital of the world. He doesn't shy away from BHAGs and that's a golden quality. In specific, the drive Gaurav has to make coaching connect with human self-awareness is most infectious part of the program. I wish you Gaurav and Erickson Coaching International India all the success for their future endeavors.

                    I had the pleasure of sharing a conversation with David about the future of coaching and his mission to create 5 million school-aged coaches and mentors. In about an hour's encounter, I was inspired about what the future of coaching can be, learned practical ways to increase my influence as a young person in this industry, and was pleasantly surprised by his elite sense of humor! One thing I'll take with me from our conversation is his advice to living a life with laughter: "Don't take yourself too seriously and never go a day without finding something ridiculous!"

                    "Who you are is how you coach". This was Gaurav's introduction sentence to coaching, as I embarked on this beautiful journey. Three months down the line, as I reflect back on how Gaurav has influenced my approach as a coach, I couldn't agree more. During the sessions that he took for us and my subsequent interactions with him, Gaurav has personified the various coach competences - never ever letting the other person get overwhelmed with his vast experience. No wonder he's among the torch-bearers when it comes to shaping wonderful coaches in India.
                    My best wishes to you Gaurav in establishing India as the coaching capital, and I look forward to contributing to this beautiful mission in whatever small way I can.

                    I have known David for over 15 years and we have worked together on a number of projects helping organizations from Goldman Sachs & N M Rothschild to the Arts Councils of England and Wales and the UK Prime Ministers Office (Cabinet Office). We have also worked together on the Executive Board of the European Mentoring & Coaching Council. The quality of mentoring we now have in Europe is primarily due to Davids work over the past 20 years developing mentoring approaches from virtually nothing to the standards we have today. As a result of learning from David I have been able to put in place top quality business focused mentoring in significant organizations such as HSBC, CHEP, UBS and law firms either in my internal roles or as a consultant.
